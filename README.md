## About the App

Don't you hate these times: friends ask you out for dinner and you keep forgetting the name of this one restaurant you always wanted to go?
Or just imagine, you see a poster of an upcoming amazing event somewhere and you directly know; I wanna go there with my best friend but how to remember?
.... Forget these struggles by using my App!
